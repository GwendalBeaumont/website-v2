## R&D mission, IMT Mines Alès (2023-2024)

The R&D mission is a group exercise in which two to three students respond to a request from an industrialist or academic on a specific subject. The main goal of this exercise is to provide an insight into the world of research to students. The expected outcome of this exercise is a brief overview of the current state of the art and the start of the implementation of a solution.
