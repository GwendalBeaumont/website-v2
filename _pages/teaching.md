## Engineering study

- **Institution**: IMT Mines Alès
- **Years dispensed**: 2024 -- 2025, 2025 -- 2026
- **Context**: The engineering study is a group exercise in which two to three students respond to a technical request on a specific topic from an academia or industry. As a supervisor, I have to define the scope of the topic the students will be working on and make sure they achieve their goals.
- **Goal**: In a short amount of time, the students must set up a technical solution with regard to specifications.

**2025 -- 2026**: *Study of digital twin development practices in open-source projects.*
 
Based on previous works on the exploration of digital twins open-source repositories, students choose to improve the methodology to find DTs on GitHub's public repositories. To do so, they implemented a new process leveraging LLMs and shell programs.

**2024 -- 2025**: *DevOps for digital twins.*

In this study, the students explored ways to find public repositories containing digital twins and create an initial dataset of DTs. They generated 300+ DT-related keywords using LLMs and used them as inputs against GitHub and Software Heritage's REST API. They found around 90,000 corresponding repositories and analysed their metadata.

## R&D mission

- **Institution**: IMT Mines Alès
- **Years dispensed**: 2023 -- 2024
- **Context**: The R&D mission is a group exercise in which two to three students respond to a request from an industrialist or academic on a specific subject. As a supervisor, I have to define the scope of the topic the students will be working on and make sure they achieve their goals.
- **Goal**: This exercise provides an insight into the world of research to students. The expected outcome of this exercise is a brief overview of the current state of the art and the start of the implementation of a solution.

**2023 -- 2024**: *Title*

## Software Development

- **Institution**: IMT Atlantique
- **Years dispensed**: 2024 -- 2025, 2025 -- 2026
