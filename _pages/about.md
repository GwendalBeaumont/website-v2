Hello all! 👋

I am a Ph.D. Candidate at IMT Atlantique, advised by [Prof. Antoine Beugnard](https://cv.hal.science/antoine-beugnard), [Assoc. Prof. Sylvain Vauttier](https://cv.hal.science/sylvainvauttier), [Assoc. Prof. Salvador Martinez](https://cv.hal.science/salvador-martinez-perez) and [Prof. Christelle Urtado](https://cv.hal.science/christelleurtado). My research interests lie in **Digital Twins** and **Model-Driven Engineering (MDE)**. My contributions mainly focus on automating the deployment and the life cycle management of Digital Twins leveraging MDE and GitOps, an implementation of DevOps centered around [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

Before that, I obtained a **General Engineer's degree** (with a speciality in **Software Engineering**) from IMT Mines Alès in 2023. During engineering school, I published three co-authored papers in the fields of **Agent-Based Modelling** and **Machine Learning** under the supervision of [Assoc. Prof. Philippe J. Giabbanelli](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=7YilOHoAAAAJ&hl=en).

Public GPG key: the key related to my academic email can be found [here](https://gwendalbeaumont.fr/gpg_imt_atlantique_fr/).
